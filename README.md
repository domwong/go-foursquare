This is WIP client library in Go for Foursquare's "venues" API. See https://developer.foursquare.com/start/search for more details. As per the docs, you will need to create your own client ID and secret to use the API.

Currently supports the following API calls

* venues/search
* venues/explore
* venues/VENUE_ID

PRs welcome to add support for missing request/response params
